#### [↖](#3_1)[↑](#3_1_1) Overview
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and
resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions
to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charge. You will be charged only for
use of other AWS services by your users.
